# Analysis of Laser Speckle Images using Unet Architecture

This repository contains the implementation of a new version U-Net (DC-UNet) used to segment different types of biomedical images. And work is to do segmentation analysis and classification.


## Dataset

In this project, we have two datasets:

- Training and testing datasets
